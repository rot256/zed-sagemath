# Zed SageMath

Adds support for [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) in the [Zed text editor](https://zed.dev/).
The [Tree Sitter Grammar is provided by HÃ¥vard Damm-Johnsen](https://github.com/havarddj/tree-sitter-sage).

## Limitations

In the future I hope to add a language server:
exploring if rewriting the Sage-specific expressions to Python (or simply using the Sage compiled)
and using a Python language server is feasible.
